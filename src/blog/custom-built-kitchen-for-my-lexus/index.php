				Designed for road trips, car camping, and everyday use – I built a kitchen for my car – featuring a high-performance cooler, a pull-out water jug, and an extendable table.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<h2>
				Pull-Out Water Jug
			</h2>
			<p>
				Mounted on smooth, sturdy rails, a 3.5-gallon water jug with a built-in faucet effortlessly slides out of the car, where it can be used for refilling water bottles, boiling water for dinner, brushing your teeth, or even for cleaning up pots and pans after a hearty meal.
			</p>

			<p>
				Wrapped in high-quality insulation, this jug remains cool even during the hottest days, ensuring crisp and refreshing water at all times.

			<h2>
				High-Performance Cooler
			</h2>
			<p>
				Encased in up to 5 inches of foam board insulation, this modified Coleman cooler is comparable in performance to name-brand coolers like Yeti. It will preserve the freshness of your food for days – even for perishables like milk and raw meat.
			</p>

			<p>
				The cooler is equipped with a Bluetooth-enabled thermometer, allowing you to monitor the internal temperature directly from your phone, providing peace of mind with the knowledge that your food is at a safe temperature.

			<h2>
				Versatile Slide-Out Table
			</h2>
			<p>
				This also doubles as a table, offering a convenient surface for setting up your portable stove or enjoying a meal on the road.
			</p>

			<p>
				This impromptu table also comes in handy when local taco trucks don't provide seating areas, or when Costco's food court is too loud and crowded.

				Seamless Lexus Styling
			</h2>
			<p>
				Beyond its functionality, every detail of this build is styled to match the car's colors and materials, featuring ivory leather wrapping on the sides and an OEM cargo mat on the top. Even the interior components have been spray-painted black to ensure a cohesive look.
			</p>

			<p>
				The tabletop is hand-carved from plywood and wrapped in wood grain vinyl, matching the car's wood trim interior and giving it a premium look.

			<h2>
				Modular Design
			</h2>
			<p>
				The cooler and water jug can both be removed for easy cleaning and restocking. Every piece is built like LEGO – held in place through interlocking friction, gravity, and magnets.

				Room for Improvement...
			</h2>
			<p>
				I am proud of this project, but it is by no means perfect.
			</p>
			<p>
				I aimed for portability so it could be easily removed from my car when needed. However, my choice of materials, primarily wood, made the final product too heavy to move effortlessly. If I were to rebuild it, I would opt for lighter materials like plastic or 3D printer filament instead of solid wood.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another failed goal was for this cooler to outperform name-brand coolers like Yeti. Although I was successful in greatly improving performance of the <a href="https://a.co/d/c3yXOAW" target="_blank">$20 Coleman cooler</a> that I started with, it was not enough to beat a Yeti. If I were to rebuild this project, I'd simply purchase a high-performance cooler instead of going the DIY route and trying to create my own.

			<h2>
				The Journey of Creation: Learning by Doing
			</h2>
			<p>
				When I first started on this project, I was stepping into uncharted territory. With no prior experience in woodworking, insulation, or anything of the sort, I had to rely on a slow process of trial and error.
			</p>
			<img src="wip1.jpg" alt="Lexus Kitchen, WIP" >
			<p>
				At first it seemed relatively straightforward. "Just mount the rails, mount the insulation, and call it a day," I thought.
			</p>
			<img src="wip2.jpg" alt="Lexus Kitchen, WIP" >
			<p>
				However, I quickly realized the complexity involved and found myself committed to resolving countless issues in an endless pursuit of perfection.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, to optimize the cooler’s performance, I created an exact mold of the cooler using spray insulation foam in a very crude process involving a tub of canola oil, a 40 lb dumbbell, a bread knife, and a lot of patience.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many other details hidden underneath the kitchen's faux leather skin:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://a.co/d/bgM2qhp" target="_blank">UHMW polyethylene tape</a> to allow the entire project to slide out smoothly and quietly
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://a.co/d/4RqTeQ5" target="_blank">Neodymium magnets</a> to catch sliding pieces and coax them into place
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://a.co/d/fkZdBF6" target="_blank">Steel braces</a> to reinforce the foam walls
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://a.co/d/40sze5R" target="_blank">2mm rubber seal strips</a> to close any air gaps around the cooler
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<img src="wip3.jpg" alt="Lexus Kitchen, WIP" >
			<p>
				But eventually I forced myself to look past the imperfections and move on to finish the project.

			<h2>
				Conclusion
			</h2>
			<p>
				The purpose of this project was never actually about having a kitchen for my car. I'm proud of what I built, but honestly it's not very practical considering how big and heavy it is. The same functionality could be achieved with just a few products from Amazon. No – the true purpose of this project was simply just to create something.
			</p>
			<p>
				There's something magical about the process of creating something – from the moment an idea first pops into my mind to the moment I show the finished product to a friend with a proud, "I made this." The journey of bringing an idea to life is an adventure that never fails to captivate me.
			</p>
			<p>
				Building this also left me with a valuable new skillset that I can apply to future projects or simply put to use in repairing things around my apartment. For me, learning through hands-on experience like this is more effective and more enjoyable than formal classes or lengthy YouTube tutorials.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lastly, I love that this kitchen acts an excuse to take a friend on an adventure – be it a road trip to Death Valley, camping in Lake Tahoe, or just a trip to Costco.

				I hope that my journey inspires you to take on your own projects and discover the joy of creating something from scratch.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks for reading!
