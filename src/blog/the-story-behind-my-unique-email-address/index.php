				My email address – k@wnd.sr – is a fully functional, ultra-short version of my name.

			<h2>
				The Perfect Email Address
			</h2>
			<p>
				When I was 9 years old, I created the email address KristianWindsor@gmail.com. It was elegantly simple – just my first and last name paired with a modern "@gmail.com". Unfortunately, I quickly lost the password and, despite my best efforts, was never able to recover the account.
			</p>
			<p>
				What followed was a string of attempts to find a new, equally satisfying email address. Each attempt felt imperfect in its own way:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I tried adding numbers,	like kristianwindsor<i>2011</i>@gmail.com, but it felt random and unprofessional.</li>
				<li>I tried shortening it by removing the trailing "r" (ie. kristian<i>windso</i>@gmail.com), but people always thought it was a typo.</li>
				<li>I tried using my own domain, like hello@<i>kristianwindsor.com</i>, but it felt too corporate – more like a customer support email than my personal one.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Most people wouldn’t think twice about something like this – it’s just an email address, after all. But to me, it was like a tiny pebble in my shoe: easy enough to ignore, yet always there, subtly bothering me. 
			</p>

			<h2>
				Inspired by Creative Domains
			</h2>
			<p>
				I've always been interested in unique and creative domain names. While most people are familiar with traditional TLDs like .com, .net, and .org – or newer ones like .io, .ai, and .xyz – there are over 1,500 TLDs in existence today, each offering exciting possibilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				Major brands like Google, Nike, and Lamborghini even use their own custom TLDs to strengthen their brand identity and showcase innovation. Check out these webpages and their cool URLs:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://about.google/" target="_blank">about.google</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.swoosh.nike/" target="_blank">swoosh.nike</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://esports.lamborghini/" target="_blank">esports.lamborghini</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The vast number of modern TLDs allows brands to seamlessly integrate their names into their domains, creating a sleek and memorable identity. Here are some of my favorite brand/domain name combinations:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://cash.app/" target="_blank">cash.app</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://sexy.pizza/" target="_blank">sexy.pizza</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://bright.green/" target="_blank">bright.green</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You can also get creative with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack" target="_blank">domain hacks</a>, where the FQDN forms readable words or phrases:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://cr.yp.to/" target="_blank">cr.yp.to</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://e.xplo.it/" target="_blank">e.xplo.it</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				These kinds of domains inspired me to think outside the box and search for something new, rather than sticking with a standard Gmail address or my existing kristianwindsor.com domain.

			<h2>
				Discovering the wnd.sr Domain
			</h2>
			<p>
				While exploring options for a new domain, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.sr" target="_blank">.sr</a> TLD, the country code for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname" target="_blank">Suriname</a>, a Dutch-speaking nation in South America.
			</p>
			<p>
				To my astonishment, the domain wnd.sr was available! It's short and sweet – just my last name spelled without vowels – exactly what I was looking for.
			</p>
			<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d7817996.430002706!2d-57.33029739715854!3d6.323498049394742!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x8d0836d5d9d3d551%3A0x1037e1c0712936b2!2sSuriname!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1735597775776!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="100%" height="450px" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
			<p>
				Although, the process to acquire the wnd.sr domain wasn’t exactly straightforward. I was confused at first because I wasn't able to buy the .sr domain on NameCheap, GoDaddy, or any common domain registrars. Eventually I came to learn that these domains can only be purchased through <a href="https://datasur.sr/domains/" target="_blank">Datasur</a>, a subsidiary of the Surinamese state-owned telecom company, Telesur.	
			</p>

			<p>
				And instead of your typical credit card payment, I paid for the domain via an international bank transfer, which came with a hefty $40 fee from Chase. Thankfully, the staff at Datasur was incredibly accommodating and allowed me to pay for five years upfront in a single transaction to minimize fees. In the end, the domain costs me about $25/year – a small price to pay for something so unique.

			<h2>
				Choosing an Email Service
			</h2>
			<p>
				At first, I considered trying free or self-hosted email solutions, but I was worried that the unusual email address paired with an unusual email server would result in mail delivery issues, such as the emails being flagged as spam. So I decided to go with Gmail. I figured the strong reputation of Gmail would help offset the quirkiness of the email address and minimize any potential issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Gmail account costs $6/month, which isn't exactly cheap, but I think it's a fair price to pay for the reliablity and peace of mind that it provides.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<h2>
				It's Short!
			</h2>
			<p>
				One of my earlier email addresses, kristianwindsor2011@gmail.com, spanned a lengthy 29 characters. By contrast, my new email, k@wnd.sr, is a mere 8 characters long. Fun fact: the shortest possible email address is just 6 characters long: x@y.zz.
			</p>
			<p>
				Typing it out is quick and easy, which comes in handy when autofill isn’t available, such as on tablets at self-serve restaurants. It’s a small convenience, only saving 10-15 seconds here and there, but it does ultimately save me some time.

			<h2>
				Personal Branding
			</h2>
			<p>
				My email address serves as a subtle yet powerful element of my personal brand, making myself a little more unique in today's vast digital landscape.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the competitive field of software engineering, where innovation and attention to detail are highly valued, a unique email like this can help me stand out amongst a sea of resumes. If I had business cards, it would serve as a great conversation starter.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<h2>
				The Risks
			</h2>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions" target="_blank">DNSSEC</a>, a security protocol that protects against DNS spoofing, isn’t available for .sr domains. Without this protection, the email address is more vulnerable to phishing attacks and unauthorized email interception.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the country of Suriname were ever to cease to exist, all .sr domains could also be deleted. This has happened a few times throughout history, such as when Yugoslavia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.yu" target="_blank">.yu domain</a> was retired in 2010 and when the Netherlands Antilles' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.an" target="_blank">.an domain</a> was discontinued in 2015. Even today, there is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41729526" target="_blank">talk about the .io domain going away</a> as the British Indian Ocean Territory will soon cease to exist.
			</p>
			<p>
				To reduce risk, I avoid using this email address for important logins like my bank account, just in case anything were to happen to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite these concerns, I’ve used it for years without any problems. Overall, I’m happy with the email address and believe its unique nature outweighs these potential problems.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Conclusion
			</h2>
			<p>
				My email address, k@wnd.sr, represents more than just a way to contact me – it’s a testament to my creativity and love for unique solutions. And, honestly, I just think it's really cool.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks for reading!
